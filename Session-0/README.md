# Session 0

In this folder, you will find the presentation slides ([Session0-Slides](https://github.com/techclubssn/DL-CV-2020/blob/master/Session-0/Session0-Slides.pdf)) and the IPython Notebook of the code we wrote in today's class ([XOR_using_NN](https://github.com/techclubssn/DL-CV-2020/blob/master/Session-0/XOR_using_NN.ipynb)).

## INSTRUCTIONS -- IMPORTANT!
Before the next week's session, be sure you do the following:
1. Go through Numpy's Tutorial given below to understand the `XOR_using_NN` code better.
2. Complete the assignment given below.
3. (Optional) Enroll in the deeplearning.ai Coursera Specialization

## How to access the IPython Notebook
If you've cloned this repository, you can go to [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true) and click on the `Upload` tab, then find the `XOR_using_NN` file in your PC and click on it.

## Numpy Tutorial
Access the Python Numpy Tutorial of CS231n [here](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/).

## Assignment

Will be posted shortly.
