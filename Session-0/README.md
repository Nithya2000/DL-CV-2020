# Session 0

In this folder, you will find the presentation slides ([Session0-Slides](https://github.com/techclubssn/DL-CV-2020/blob/master/Session-0/Session0-Slides.pdf)) and the IPython Notebook of the code we wrote in today's class ([XOR_using_NN](https://github.com/techclubssn/DL-CV-2020/blob/master/Session-0/XOR_using_NN.ipynb)).

## INSTRUCTIONS -- IMPORTANT!
Before the next week's session, be sure you do the following:
1. Go through Numpy Tutorial given below to understand the `XOR_using_NN` code better.
2. Complete the assignment given below.
3. (Optional) Enroll in the deeplearning.ai Coursera Specialization

## How to access the IPython Notebook
If you've cloned this repository, you can go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true) and click on the `Upload` tab, then find the `XOR_using_NN` file in your PC and click on it.

## Numpy Tutorial
Access the Python Numpy Tutorial of CS231n [here](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/).

## Assignment

Head over to the assignment notebook [Assignment-0.ipynb](https://github.com/techclubssn/DL-CV-2020/blob/master/Session-0/Assignment_0.ipynb) and complete tasks 1, 2 and 3. More details in the notebook. Open the `Assignment_0.ipynb` file in Google Colab to run the code, like you did with `XOR_using_NN.ipynb`.

The assignment should take just about 1 hour to complete.

**Important note:** In the notebook, we've mentioned that you should write your inferences in a document. It is sufficient if you **write the inferences for all three tasks in the same document**.

Use **LaTeX** or any word processing software like **MS Word** to write the document. We recommend you to start getting used to **LaTeX** as it's used in Research worldwide. It's very simple to learn, just head over to [Overleaf's Documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn) to start learning.

### How to submit your assignment

We want you guys to get used to GitHub. So, once you've forked the DL-CV-2020 repository, you can upload the following files in the Session-0 folder in your forked repo:

1. The `Assignment-0-solved.ipynb` file that consists of the code you wrote.
2. The `Assignment-0.pdf` file that consists of your documented inferences. **Note:** Only upload as PDF, not .docx or others. Please mention your name/both names of your team in this PDF file.

**Upload the files to your repo by 12 noon, Feb 3, 2020 (Monday)**.
